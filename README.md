We applied Fourier transformation on an image to identify the Camouflaged Object in it. We used python programing language to do the task. 
In order to complete the task, we used python Libraries like Open CV, NumPy, Matplotlib. 
The basic idea behind applying Fourier Transformation is to convert the Spatial domain into Frequency domain. This will help us to identify the texture and details of a Camouflaged image.
